# Simulated-Annealing
Simulated Annealing is an optimization algorithm that mimics the annealing process in metallurgy, where a material is slowly cooled to reduce defects and reach a stable state. In the context of problem-solving, it seeks to find the best solution by exploring a solution space without exhaustive search.

 
This repository contains a Colaboratory Notebook, with the solution of a problem in which i try to maximize the value of a ecuation using a binary array as the initial and final solution for the problem.

Just download the SA.ipynb file and add it to your folder for colaboratory notebooks in google drive.
