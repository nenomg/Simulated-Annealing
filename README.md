# Simulated-Annealing
Simulated Annealing is an optimization algorithm that mimics the annealing process in metallurgy, where a material is slowly cooled to reduce defects and reach a stable state. In the context of problem-solving, it seeks to find the best solution by exploring a solution space without exhaustive search.
